# Code-Overflow
Code-Overflow is an event organized by the Linux and Open Source Community, dedicated to nurturing students' interest in programming and open-source development.

Our primary objective is to provide an ideal platform for beginners to embark on their coding journey and develop a genuine passion for problem-solving. We encourage participants to begin with competitive programming, as it offers an exciting and engaging way to immerse themselves in the world of coding. By mastering the art of problem-solving through this avenue, participants can develop a strong foundation in programming.

Once participants meet specific criteria and gain confidence in their coding abilities, we encourage them to venture into developing small-scale projects. These projects serve as an invaluable means to sharpen their skills and expand their horizons in the programming realm.

At Code-Overflow, we pride ourselves on advocating a unique top-down approach, which enables students to swiftly familiarize themselves with the world of Open Source Software (OSS). Through this approach, participants gain practical exposure at a rapid pace, fostering a deeper understanding of OSS and its real-world applications.

We understand the disparity between conventional college curricula and the dynamic domain of OSS. Therefore, Code-Overflow aims to bridge this gap effectively. By exposing students to OSS early in their learning journey, we empower them to become proficient contributors to the open-source community.

Join us at Code-Overflow, where innovation meets collaboration, and where students can unlock their true potential as skilled programmers and open-source enthusiasts. Let us embark on this exciting quest together, as we shape the future of technology through coding excellence and the spirit of open-source development.
