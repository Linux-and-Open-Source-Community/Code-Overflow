# Code-Overflow
Code-Overflow is an event conducted by Linux and Open Source Community for fostering the interest of students in programming and open source.

Beginners are advised to start with competitive programming to get the vibe of coding and to develop a knack for problem-solving. Once a certain criterion is met and you feel comfortable with coding, you can start developing small projects to hone your skills.

Instead of the traditional bottom-up approach, where we learn the theory first and then practice, we advise a top-down approach that allows you to get exposed to OSS quickly. This allows students to get practical exposure faster.

There is a huge gap between what the college curriculum offers and OSS and this is an attempt to bridge that gap.
